## 🚀 What we do

We design and maintain open-source projects that students, clubs, and communities at PESU actually use. Some highlights include:

* 🔑 [PESUAuth](https://github.com/pesu-dev/auth) – Authentication API used by the PESU Discord server and other clubs/servers  
* 🐍 [pesuacademy-py](https://github.com/pesu-dev/pesuacademy) – A Python wrapper for PESU Academy, offering read-only access to the platform  
* 🔐 [PESU OAuth2](https://github.com/pesu-dev/oauth2) – OAuth2 interaction layer to support application development across clubs and groups  
* 🤖 [askPESU](https://github.com/pesu-dev/ask-pesu) – A QA bot for PES students  
* 🌐 [PESU-API](https://github.com/pesu-dev/pesu-api) – A set of APIs built on top of our existing projects, powering many of our tools
* 🔗 [Auth Link Portal](https://github.com/pesu-dev/auth-link-portal) – A website built for verification of students into the PESU Discord server
  

> [!NOTE]  
> Most of these projects are _live_ in production and used by students every day. They're not just class projects — they're real, impactful tools built by the community 💡.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who we are

* ❌ We are not a club, and we're not officially affiliated with PES University  
* 👨‍🎓 Run by alumni and students, open to anyone who wants to contribute  
* 🌱 Started as side projects by a few people (*Rowlet from Reddit* & *Han from Discord*), now grown into a welcoming dev space with contributors across batches (yes, even 2029 batch 👀)  

> [!TIP]
> Our contributors range from beginners writing their first lines of code, to seasoned engineers mentoring the next generation ✨.

* 🧑‍🏫 Mentorship → Alumni & seniors guide you so you're never stuck  
* ⚙️ Real-world SWE practices → Git, PRs, CI/CD, staging/production — just like industry  
* 🎯 Impact → The stuff you build here is used by hundreds of PESU students and communities  

> [!TIP]  
> This is a great way to go beyond classroom projects and experience real collaborative software engineering 🚀.

## 🛠️ Onboarding & Setup

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Before you start contributing, there are a few things you'll need to have set up. Don't worry — we'll guide you through it! 🚀

### ✅ Prerequisites
- 🐧 Linux or macOS → All projects are developed and tested on Unix-based systems.  
  * On Windows, you can use **WSL2** or **dual boot Linux**.  
- 🌱 Version Control Basics → You must be familiar with Git & version control.  
  * At the very least, go through the [MIT Missing Semester: Version Control](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/) lecture.  
  * (Highly recommended: the entire [Missing Semester course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/)).  
- 📝 Code Editor/IDE → Install your favorite editor (VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains, etc).  
- 🔑 Git Setup → Make sure you have Git installed and configured on your system. You'll also need Git with SSH authentication set up to interact with our repositories; follow this guide: [How to Set Up Git SSH](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-ssh-how-to/).
